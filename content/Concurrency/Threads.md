A **thread** is the smallest unit of execution, a sequence of instructions, that the operating system can schedule and run on a CPU.

A **process** is an executing program with its own memory space and resources, and it contain one or more **threads**.

**Processes** have separate memory space and IO resources, threads of the same process share the same memory space and IO resource.

# Running a Thread

Threads need to use the CPU to be executed. A thread running on a CPU have two different ways to progress:
- **Concurrency**: Multiple threads switch turns to make progress (one or more CPU cores)
- **Parallelism**: Multiple threads literally run in parallel (require multi-core CPUs)

When the OS switches to current running thread to a different one, it is called a **context switch**. Switching involves saving the current thread's registers, program counter, and other CPU states; and loading in the next thread's state.

Threads that have been switched out need to **wait**.

A thread that can guarantee progress in its program and pass it own to others is called to be **live**.

# Thread States

Threads have multiple states that indicates what should the OS do with it.

- **New** -> being created, waiting to be admitted by the OS scheduler.
- **Ready** -> waiting to be schedule on the CPU.
- **Running** -> currently executing.
- **Blocked** -> paused, waiting for I/O or synchronization.
- **Terminated** -> finished execution, waiting to have its resources free by the OS.

Threads that never terminate are called **zombie threads**.

# Coordination

A thread that waits for a resource or another thread is called **synchronous** to that thread. Otherwise, if it does not wait and moves on to do more work is called **asynchronous** relative to that thread.

Threads share resources and memory inside a process, each thread needs to coordinate (or being synchronized) with other threads to execute properly. It needs [[Synchronization primitives]]. 

## Synchronizing Threads

You may check out the [[Synchronization primitives]] guide for a closer look. 

A major building block is **Mutual Exclusion Locks** (Mutexes or Locks) - these enforce synchronization to all threads that have it. 

> [!note] 
> The first thread that acquire the lock have exclusive right to a section of code and the memory it may access. This is called a **critical section** of the code, and it forces others to **pause** execution if they acquire the lock in their run time until the 

Thread that try to get the lock and are said to have **lock contention**. Any other resource is called **thread contention** and are forced to wait.

Threads need to make memory consistent also across caches when they update a variable. These functionality are provided with **atomic variables** (implemented with memory barriers in assembly code).

# Concurrency Bugs

Errors while designing for multi-threading is hard to debug, for it has **emergence** properties. One thread interacting with another can create emergent and interesting behaviors.

> A multi-threaded program is more than the sum of its parts.

Often, these are symptoms of bad programming, so check out [[Concurrency Bugs]] for a list. 

Here are the three major concurrency bugs:
- **Race condition** - When two threads overwrite the progress of another unexpectedly, it is called a **race condition**.  Broadly, it is a bug where sequence of threads lead to inconsistent or unexpected behavior.
- **Deadlock** - When a thread that has acquired the mutual lock crashes, the rest of the threads that waits for it will halt forever. This is called a **deadlock**. 
- **Starvation** - When a thread will never get access to a needed resource (a file for example) while other threads constantly accesses it, that thread will wait forever. This thread is under **starvation**. 

Once all concurrency bugs are deemed squashed, it is called **thread-safe**. 

Operations and variables that are thread-safe are called **atomic**. Executing or using them are guranteed to be safe to use.

# Concurrency Design Patterns

Programming in multi-threading can be difficult because of said emergent properties, but there are strategies to mitigate this.

> [!hint]
> First, do [[Concurrency Problem Analysis| problem analysis]] to lay down what is the nature of the problem, and what should the solution account for.

These are some useful design pattern terminology:
- **Worker Thread** - a thread or object that performs tasks
- **Thread pool** - a group of reusable worker threads
- **Dispatcher** (or **Scheduler**) - code that assigns work from a queue to workers
- **Load Balancer** - code that distributes work evenly among workers
- **Pipeline** - a sequential order of threads where one's result is the other's task.
